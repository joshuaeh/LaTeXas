abstract = {The National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB), consisting of solar radiation and meteorological data over the United States and regions of the surrounding countries, is a publicly open dataset that has been created and disseminated during the last 23 years. This paper briefly reviews the complete package of surface observations, models, and satellite data used for the latest version of the NSRDB as well as improvements in the measurement and modeling technologies deployed in the NSRDB over the years. The current NSRDB provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Physical Solar Model (PSM) and products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the National Ice Center's (NIC's) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The NSRDB irradiance data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean percentage biases within 5\% and 10\% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb.nrel.gov or through an application programming interface (API). During the last 23 years, the NSRDB has been widely used by an ever-growing group of researchers and industry both directly and through tools such as NREL's System Advisor Model.}

abstract = {Regional wind integration studies in the United States require detailed wind power output data at many locations to perform simulations of how the power system will operate under high-penetration scenarios. The wind data sets that serve as inputs into the study must realistically reflect the ramping characteristics, spatial and temporal correlations, and capacity factors of the simulated wind plants, as well as be time synchronized with available load profiles. The Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit described in this article fulfills these requirements as the largest and most complete grid integration data set publicly available to date. A meteorological data set, wind power production time series, and simulated forecasts created using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model run on a 2-km grid over the continental United States at a 5-min resolution is now publicly available for more than 126,000 land-based and offshore wind power production sites. State-of-the-art forecast accuracy was mimicked by reforecasting the years 2007â€“2013 using industry-standard techniques. Our meteorological and power validation results show that the WIND Toolkit data is satisfactory for wind energy integration studies. Users are encouraged to validate according to their phenomena and application of interest.}

abstract = {The share of solar power in the global and local energy mixes has increased dramatically in the past decade. Consequently, there has been a significant rise in the interest for solar power forecasting, for different time horizons, ranging from few minutes to seasons. For day-ahead forecasts, combination of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and post-processing algorithms is the most popular approach. Many recent publications have proposed innovative NWP post-processing methods. However, because different works use different datasets, metrics, and even cross-validation methods, it is rarely possible to fairly compare results across several papers. In this work, we propose a rigorous benchmark of several solar NWP post-processing models representative of the literature. For our results to be as general as possible, the comparison is conducted with an open dataset, over 6 years and 7 locations. In addition, we propose a novel benchmarking approach, that focuses on the systematicity of the ranking of forecasting models. Our results show that, when used in combination with proper regularization, large predictor sets are systematically beneficial to NWP post-processing methods. They also demonstrate that more complex algorithms such as neural networks and gradient boosting generally have the lowest mean square error, while support vector regression, a more parsimonious algorithm, performs better in terms of mean absolute error. Lastly, the focus given to ranking systematicity reveals that no model is better in all occasions. This means that researchers should be measured when they conclude to the superiority of a model, in particular when testing data is scarce.}
